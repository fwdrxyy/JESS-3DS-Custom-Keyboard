# JESS-3DS-Custom-Keyboard
a 3DS custom keyboard made JESS.

## This repo was just made to use this to add to websites and etc.

## How to install? (MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BACKUP OF ORIGINAL KEYBOARD SO YOU CAN RESTORE IT!!)
- Download the cia file and transfer it to to your 3DS using ftpd or manually doing it by removing the sd card and putting it into your computer.
- Please note this is USA ONLY! So it wont work on EUR, JP, and etc. Region consoles!
- Once your done transfering, close ftpd or put your sd card back into your 3ds.
- Launch FBI, Click on "SD Card"
- Find where you put the CIA. Click on it and select "Install and Delete CIA"
- Once its done reboot your 3DS
- Test the keyboard out on a app where it uses the keyboard (eg: Friend List).
- If you see on the spacebar "By Jess" it worked!

## Enjoy the keyboard!
